## Intro

This repository is based on Ciganda, D. & Todd, N. (2021) "Demographic Models of the Reproductive Process: Past, Interlude, and Future". Population Studies. <https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2021.1959943>. And try to bring it to a R package, where the main function is `comfert()` where the model itself is implemented.

The function `main_local()` allows you to runs the estimation algorithm in a "local"
computing cluster (without a job scheduler), and the function `main_remote()` manages the computation in a remote (external) cluster running on Slurm.


In the data folder are all the files you need to try this method with all the dataset for Spain example.
